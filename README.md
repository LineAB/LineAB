## Why am I here?

<!--
**LineAB/LineAB** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

If you've landed on my profile we must be working together on a project, but if not I'll direct you to notice how barren it is here.

Hopefully, I've covered everything there is to know about me ðŸ˜„.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning about AI, and gathering material to read.
- ðŸ“« Can I reach you? Please don't try; I'm in the Data Science Learning Community (https://dslc.io) if you are as well our paths might cross one day.
- ðŸ¤” Do I need any help? I've received plenty of help.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Owls are incredibly adept at silent flight, largely due to the unique structure of their feathers.
